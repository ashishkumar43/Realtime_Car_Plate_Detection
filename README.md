![License Plate Detection](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/your-image-url.png)  

### 🔍 Real-Time Detection | 🎯 High Accuracy | 🛡️ Fraud Prevention  

--- 

### 📌 About the Project  
This **AI-powered License Plate Detection System** leverages **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for high-speed, real-time object detection and **Tesseract OCR** for accurate text extraction from vehicle plates. The system validates plates against a predefined format to flag potential fraudulent ones.  

🚀 **Built With:**  
- **YOLO** for license plate detection  
- **Tesseract OCR** for character recognition  
- **Streamlit** for an interactive user interface  
- **Python & OpenCV** for image processing  
- **gTTS** for text-to-speech alerts
